# Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction
Hello, My name is George Chen and welcome to my data science project page, I am a data science candidate looking for opportunities to apply data science/machine learning/deep learning/statistics to solve real world business problems. I have completed two capstone projects to demonstrate my skills.

### Diabetes onset detection
In this project we have used data cleaning/wrangling, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering for our raw data treatment and compare different machine learning model performance to predict the onset of diabetes from subjects. We use both accuracy and f1 score as our evaluation metrics. We found the support vector machine paired with median-min-max data treatment to be our best model that can reach over 77% of accuracy and decision tree with median-min-max-PCA data treatment to reach f1 score around 0.71 to be the best among all.

### ATP tennis match outcome prediction
In this project, our goal is to use stats from previous matches players played as features to predict their future matches outcome. We used both traditional machine learning models as well as deep learning models to compare the result. We have also done feature selection and engineering to extract the most valuable features for our model. We were able to reach nearly 93% of test set accuracy consistently and also use it to predict the winning/losing percentage of a player in a certain match, which could be a potential application for sports bidding companies to use as a reference to set up the odds of every single upcoming match.
