The collection of dataset was inspired by the movie [Somm](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2204371/), which is a documentary movie that describes four sommeliers attempt to pass the Master Sommelier exam, a test with one of the lowest pass rates in the world.\n",

    "The reason I chose this dataset for my exploration report is that I found wine tasting a pretty important social skills and the more knowledge you have regarding wines, people seems to show more interests and repects of you. This dataset consists of around 280K observations and I think this is a good start of my first capstone project for exploratory data analysis practice.\n",
