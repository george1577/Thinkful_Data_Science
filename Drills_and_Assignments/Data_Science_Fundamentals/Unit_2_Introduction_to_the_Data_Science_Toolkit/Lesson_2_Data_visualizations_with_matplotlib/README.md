# Challenge - What Do You See?

Let's go out into the world and generate some beautiful visuals. Pick a data source from [this aggregation](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/data-201-resources/blob/master/data-sources.md), load the data into a pandas data frame, and generate a series of visuals around that data using pyplot.

Each visualization should be accompanied by 2-3 sentences describing what you think is revealed by this representation. Generate at least four different visuals, and be sure to use different types as well as the subplot functionality discussed above. And remember: clean and elegant visuals are key to telling a coherent story.

Collect your images and descriptions into a shareable format. A Jupyter notebook is best, but anything you can link to is fine, including Google docs or markdown files on [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [gists](https://gist.github.com/), and share the link below.
