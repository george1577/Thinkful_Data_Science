    "### 1. You work at an e-commerce company that sells three goods: widgets, doodads, and fizzbangs. The head of advertising asks you which they should feature in their new advertising campaign. You have data on individual visitors' sessions (activity on a website, pageviews, and purchases), as well as whether or not those users converted from an advertisement for that session. You also have the cost and price information for the goods."

    "I will focus on the product that has the worse conversion rate if the visitors have viewed that page/product and try to make more advertising in the new campaign. In order to identify which product we should focus, we will utilize the data we have collected from the past, for example, using the data of activity on a website and the pageviews, we are able to make a visualization which product has the least visit or the least view. Then we can set up a condition: if visitor has visited the product webpage for a given period of time, what are the chances that they will eventually make a purchase? If the visitor has visited the product webpage time duration is high, but the conversion rate is low, that probably suggests that we need to have some new advertising stuff that can change their mind, perhaps adding a live chat window to see if visitors have any question regarding the products, or pop out a coupon code to have visitor to apply it after they put the products into the shopping cart. Of course, the cost and price has to play into the roles as well, if the cost of advertising outweight the profit of the products, we might further consider whether to focus on this particular product or not.

The onboarding funnel has three steps: email and password signup, plan choice, and payment. On a user level you have information on what steps they have completed as well as timestamps for all of those events for the past 3 years. You also have information on marketing spend on a weekly level."

    "From the data we have collected in the past 3 years, we can break the data into two groups: clients that have visited the websites AND eventually signed up v.s. clients that have visited the webisted BUT did not sign up in the end. For those we did not sign up at the end, we could further break into sub-group using those three steps, clients who stuck at step 1, clients who set up email and password but did not make a choice and clients completed the first two steps but did not make the payment. From the data collected, we will know which steps that clients got stuck the most, for example,if most of the people who set up their email and password but did not make a plan choice, we might combine those two steps together in one and maybe show some incentives like free trial for a month on the page. For another example, if most people have set up their email and password, made a plan choice, but did not make a payment, we could add another incentive like if they sign up now, they could get a discount or so. The marketing spending would be another consideration as well, we need to calculate the marginal profit after we make the changes, by putting a lot of resource/fund but only a slight increase of signup rate is apparently a bad idea."

Based on the historical data we have collected, we are able to assign some sort of \"preference score\" to every hotel under our website for a specific client(customized), thus we could rank by the preference score and the clients are more likely to book them when they see their preferred hotels on the first page."

From those data, we might be able to predict some potential users that are going to stop using before they actually stop using, we could customize their pages by providing more interesting videos/articles they have shown interests in the past or start recommending their friends on the website to tag them in the photos or some social events."
