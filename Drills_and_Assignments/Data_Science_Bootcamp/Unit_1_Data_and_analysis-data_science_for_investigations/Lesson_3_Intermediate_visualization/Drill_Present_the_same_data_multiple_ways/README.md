# Drill: Present the same data multiple ways

The best way to learn plotting is to make a lot of plots. To complete the following you may need to explore [the seaborn documentation](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html).

## Drills
Find a dataset you'd like to explore. This can be something you're familiar with or something new. Create a Jupyter notebook and then:
1. Choose one variable and plot that variable four different ways.
2. Choose two continuous variables, and plot them three different ways.
3. Choose one continuous variable and one categorical variable, and plot them six different ways.

Give the pros and cons of each plot you create. You can use variables from multiple datasets if you like.

## Challenge
As an optional challenge, find a dataset with at least four continuous variables and one categorical variable. Create one master plot that gives insight into the variables and their interrelationships, including:

1. Probability distributions
2. Bivariate relationships
3. Whether the distributions or the relationships vary across groups

Accompany your plot with a written description of what you see.

When you've completed these exercises, share your results with your mentor.
