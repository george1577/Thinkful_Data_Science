# Challege: Airbnb cities

Once you have your database set up, run some queries to start understanding your city's Airbnbs. Here are some questions you should try to answer:

1. What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?

2. What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?

3. What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? What about the busiest?
