    "#### 1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used."

    "First of all, the person who delivered the slogan are different in each group, perhaps Emperor Palpatine is better in speeching, no matter which slogan he delivers might both have the same high dark side sign up rate. To correct the design, the same person has to deliver both slogans, so if we see the difference, we know it is from the slogan itself not the person who delivers it."

    "#### 2. In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future."

    "The planets envoys are sent to are different, since Jar Jar visited four friendly planets, this might imply the residents in that planets are already more favorable to Jedi, on the other hand, since Windu has visited four unfriendly planets, most of the residents in those planets might be unfriendly to Jedi already. To redesign the experiment, we could do the attitude survey first before sending out the envoys and do another survey after sending out the envoys, so we know the effectiveness after sending out the envoys, maybe in Jar Jar's case, it only increase from 70% to 75% and in Mindu's case it actually increased from 20% to 65%. Another thing to change is to let two envoys to visit 2 friendly and 2 unfriendly planets to try to keep the sample treated similar to each other."

You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report."

When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to \"opt in\" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily."

She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it."

The experiment could be redesigned by randomizing the test version that are distributed to students, so each version of test contains a similar population of student, for example, they all have students with same grade, gender distribution...etc."
