Sample: In sample selection, we will do it as random as possible, we will recruit two groups of people with about the same distribution in terms of age, gender, height, weight...etc, one group will be treated with the current formula and the other group will be treated with new supplement, people do not know which group they are in, in other words, they do not know whether they are taking the new or the old pills.\n",

For example, we have the sales two years ago from Jan. to Jun., we have the same period of sales last year, record the sales increase, we have the sales for this year(with new uniforms), record the sales increase again and compare these two differences."
