# DRILL: Prepare the Data
[Download the Excel](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/table_8_offenses_known_to_law_enforcement_new_york_by_city_2013.xls) file here on crime data in New York State in 2013, provided by the FBI: UCR ([Thinkful mirror](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thinkful-Ed/data-201-resources/master/New_York_offenses/NEW_YORK-Offenses_Known_to_Law_Enforcement_by_City_2013%20-%2013tbl8ny.csv)).

Prepare this data to model with multivariable regression (including data cleaning if necessary) according to this specification:

**_Propertycrime=Î±+Population+Population2+Murder+Robbery_**


The 'population' variable is already set for you, but you will need to create the last three features. Robbery and Murder are currently continuous variables. For this model, please use these variables to create categorical features where values greater than 0 are coded 1, and values equal to 0 are coded 0. You'll use this data and model in a later assignment- for now, just write the code you need to get the data ready. Don't forget basic data cleaning procedures, either! Do some graphing to see if there are any anomalous cases, and decide how you want to deal with them.
