# Drill: More clusters?
Your task is to take the  𝑘 -means code here and see what happens when you change the value of  𝑘 . What solution, if any, do you find most compelling? Does complexity start to become an issue with this data set? Play around a bit and write up your findings and your process to share with your mentor. Keep in mind that it may be possible to have a solution with more than two clusters that is still better at tracking the real binary outcome – two of those clusters may map to "heart disease" while the other maps to "no heart disease," for example.
