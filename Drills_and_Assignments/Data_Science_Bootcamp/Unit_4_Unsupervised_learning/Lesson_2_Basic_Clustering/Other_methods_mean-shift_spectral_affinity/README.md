# DRILL: Mo' blobs, mo' problems?
You've seen how these three methods work on three blobs of reasonably separated data. Now go back and change the data. Create more or fewer blobs, and set the blobs closer together or farther apart. Set up at least three different blob configuations, then run the four methods ( ùëò -means, mean shift, spectral clustering and affinity propagation) on each one. Write up a report for your mentor where you discuss what you learned about the clustering methods based on their relative performance for your different blob setups.
