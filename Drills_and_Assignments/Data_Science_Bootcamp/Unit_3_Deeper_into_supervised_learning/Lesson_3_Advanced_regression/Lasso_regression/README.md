# Regularization parameter: Lasso

The $\lambda$ for lasso can var between 0 (no penalty, acts like OLS) and infinity.  If $\lambda$ is too large, all parameters will be set to zero.  

Create a plot below of how $R^2$ varies across different values of $\lambda$ for ridge and lasso regression. Use logic and code similar to the ridge regression demonstration above, and base your plot on the X_train2 feature set.

Do lasso and ridge yield the same $R^2$ for a given lambda value?

Submit your work and discuss the results with your mentor.
