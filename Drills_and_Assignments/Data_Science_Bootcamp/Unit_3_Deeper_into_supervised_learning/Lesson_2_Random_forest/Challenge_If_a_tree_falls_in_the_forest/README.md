# Challenge: If a tree falls in the forest...
Now that you've learned about random forests and decision trees let's do an exercise in accuracy. You know that random forests are basically a collection of decision trees. But how do the accuracies of the two models compare?

So here's what you should do. Pick a dataset. It could be one you've worked with before or it could be a new one. Then build the best decision tree you can.

Now try to match that with the simplest random forest you can. For our purposes measure simplicity with runtime. Compare that to the [runtime](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1557571/how-do-i-get-time-of-a-python-programs-execution) of the decision tree. This is imperfect but just go with it.

Hopefully out of this you'll see the power of random forests, but also their potential costs. Remember, in the real world you won't necessarily be dealing with thousands of rows. It could be millions, billions, or even more.
