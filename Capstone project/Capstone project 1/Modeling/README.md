# Diabetes Onset Detection -- Modeling

## Goal
1. Try different algorithms and build the prediction model
   * Naive Bayes
   * K-Nearest Neighbors
   * Logistic Regression
   * Decision Tree
   * Random Forest
   * Support Vector Machine
   * Gradient Boosting
2. Try different error metrics to evaluate the performance
   * Accuracy (Check model 1)
   * f1 score (Check model 2)
   * Recall and precision (Check model 2)
3. Compare different imputation and normalization method
   * Impute with mean
   * Impute with median
   * Z-score normalization
   * Min-max scaling
4. Use dimension reduction method
   * PCA
5. Find out the best combination between algorithm and engineered data
