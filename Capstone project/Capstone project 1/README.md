### Introduction
Diabetes mellitus is characterized by abnormally high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. When the amount of glucose in the blood increases, it triggers the release of the hormone insulin from the pancreas. Insulin stimulates muscle and fat cells to remove glucose from the blood and stimulates the liver to metabolize glucose, causing the blood sugar level to decrease to normal levels.

There are majority two types of diabetes, type 1(5%) is an autoimmune disorder and type 2(95%) is asociated with obesity. With the rise of obesity in the United States, diabetes accounts for over 130 billion dollars of health care costs and is the fifth leading cause of death(ref.1). the number of new cases being diagnosed continues to rise. It has been estimated that of the children born in the year 2000, 1 of 3 will suffer from diabetes at some point in their lifetime(ref.2).

## Goal
Diabetes is a chronic disease, we have not found an effective cure so far, it is without a doubt that prevention and prediction of diabetes is significantly important. In this project, we will use the dataset that is available from [data.world](https://data.world/data-society/pima-indians-diabetes-database), this dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The patients here are all females adults from [Pima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pima_people) group that lives in Arizona, they have been subject of intensive diabetes studies due to the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the world, much more than is observed in other U.S. populations.

## Data Cleaning
1. Examine data types, missing values, outliers.
2. Perform windsorization, imputation.
3. Prepare training and testing set for model use.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Perform univariate analysis to find out distribution of variables.
2. Perform bivariate analysis to find out relationship between variables.
3. Find important features that are highly associated with outcome variable.
4. Perform statistical hypothesis test.

## Feature Engineering
1. Generate feature interaciton variables.
2. Perform principal component analysis.
3. Prepare all the engineered data for both training and testing set.

**Complete notebook**: [Feature engineering](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Desktop/Thinkful/projects/Capstone%201/Feature%20Engineering/Feature%20Engineering.ipynb)

## Modeling
1. Use different algorithm and data pair to find out the best combination.
2. Use different error metrics to determine model performance.
3. Determine the best model in terms of score, training time and consistency of performance.
